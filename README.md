I am **Samantha Bales**, a dual-enrolled high school student pursuing a B.S. in Technology Project Management from Davenport University. Website development is my current passion and what I want to do as a career in the future. Speaking of, I am in the middle of creating a personal website containing:<br>
* 🐇 a professional portfolio, contacts, etc.<br>
* ❄️ pages showcasing my silliness.
